This fold includes 6 '.m' files:
one_hot_encoding.m -- pre-processing function
normalize.m -- pre-processing function
knn_classify.m --  function required
hw1p4c.m -- codes to solve 4c
hw1p4d.m -- codes to solve 4d
knn_classify_noa.m -- a new function for 4d solutions

To reproduce my results, two functions will be firstly executed for pre-processing my data, i.e. first apply 'one_hot_encoding' and then 'normalize' to original '.data' files, e.g. 'car_train.data'. With the outputs, 'knn_classify.m' could be tested. For detailed steps, please refer to 'hw1p4c.m'.

To solve 4d, I implemented another function called 'knn_classify_noa'. For more details, please refer to 'hw1p4d.m'.
